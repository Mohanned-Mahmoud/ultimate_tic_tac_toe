# 🎮 **Ultimate Tic Tac Toe**

## 📖 **Overview**  
**Ultimate Tic Tac Toe** is an advanced version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It introduces a strategic layer where each move not only impacts the local 3x3 grid but also determines the next available board for your opponent. The goal is to win three smaller grids in a row, column, or diagonal on the larger 3x3 grid.
